This projects helps demonstrate clean, flexible, and maitainable code by levraging the following language constructs for Java,SpringBoot applications
1. Usage of javax.validators 
2. Usage of @ExceptionsHandlers, and @ControllerAdvice
3. Usage of Vertical Slicing for domain oriented design
4. Usage of Single Table design using Relational database to improve application performance 
5. Usage of Spring ApplicationEvents for Event driven components 

The desciption is provided in post here : 

----
Java 11 or above
SpringBoot 
Embedded H2
Postgres
----


== What you'll build
You'll build a springboot application as metioned in the 


== What you'll need

java_version: 1.11 
Spring ApplicationEvents 


Pleae check pom.xml for a list of all dependencies for other functionalities : 
Embedded H2, Postgres.



== Create an com.graphql.Application class
Here you create an `com.graphql.Application` class with the components:

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

== Create GraphQL schema definition file
The IDL for this project is located in src.main/resources/persons.graphqls
This files is responsible for binding the operations to the request.

We can do it programmatically using java. 

== Create a com.graphql.query.Query
Here you will create a graphQL query which implements the query operations by aggregating data from SpringBoot repositories. 

----
The methods in this class are mapped with schema file
type Query {
    queryAllPeople : [Person]
    queryPersonById(id: String) : Person
    queryPersonWithDetailsById(id: String) : PersonInfo
}
----
Be carful while wiring the name and signaturs of this operations, else you might not see responses. 

== Create a com.graphql.mutation.Mutation
Here you will create a graphQL query which implements the query operations by aggregating data from SpringBoot repositories. 

----
The methods in this class are mapped with schema file
type Mutation {
  mutatePersonName(firstName: String!) : Person
  mutatePersonNameAge(firstName: String!, age: Int!) : Person
}
----
Be carful while wiring the name and signaturs of this operations, else you might not see responses. 



== Create a simple web application using com.graphql.controller.GraphQlEndpoint
`src/main/java/com/sbawa/graphql/GraphQLEndPoint.java`

The class is flagged as a `@RestController`, meaning it's ready for use by Spring MVC to handle web requests. 
`@RequestMapping` maps `/` to the `index()` method. When invoked from a browser or using curl on the command line, the method returns pure text. That's because `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, two annotations that results in web requests returning data rather than a view.


----
This single class is responsible to provide the endpoitn for all GraphQl needs for this application.
It is capable of serving variety of queries and mutation over a single endpoint
   
   @RequestMapping(value = "/graphql", method = RequestMethod.POST, produces = "text/plain")
   public String query(@RequestBody String request) {
      ...
   }


----
 
Also,this class is responsible to wire GrahQL specific features with rest endpoint.
This reads the schema file and registers the available queries and mutations to serve graphQl API needs. 


    @PostConstruct
    public void loadSchema() throws IOException {
        Resource resource = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:persons.graphqls");
        GraphQLSchema schema = SchemaParser.newParser()
                                .file(resource.getFilename())
                                .resolvers(query, mutation)
                                .build()
                                .makeExecutableSchema();
        this.graphQl = GraphQL.newGraphQL(schema).build();
    }

== Integration Tests
`com.sbawa.server.api.elastic.controller.GraphQLEndPointTest` 

This class contains integration tests for all the queries and mutations available with this endpoint. 
Its better to write test cases around max data offered by API rather than asserting subset.


== Run the application
To run the application, using Maven, execute:


[subs="attributes"]
----
mvn package && java -jar target/graphql-java-server-0.1.0.jar
----

You should see some output like this:
2018-11-19 14:50:22.646  INFO 3712 --- [           main] o.s.j.e.a.AnnotationMBeanExporter        : Bean with name 'dataSource' has been autodetected for JMX exposure

....
Check out the service.

....

----
Call the following from any rest client!

http://localhost:8080/graphql
Request: 
query{
	queryPersonById(id:"101"){
		age
        firstName
        id
	}
}


You should see a response like: 

{
    "queryPersonById": {
        "age": 21,
        "firstName": "person1",
        "id": 101
    }
}

----

....


You will see a new set of RESTful end points added to the application. These are management services provided by Spring Boot.

----
 Summary
Congratulations on spinning up your first GraphQl APIinside JVM and wrapped in RestController.
